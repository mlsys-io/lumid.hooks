"""Identity-provider hook.

Resolves bearer tokens to a `PrincipalContext`. Each provider may claim a
token (return PrincipalContext), pass it on (return None), or reject it as
invalid by raising an exception (FastAPI's HTTPException is the documented
choice for terminal failures, but the protocol does not import fastapi).
